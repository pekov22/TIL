<h1>HTML</h1>
<p style="margin-top:45px">Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the <br>
standard markup language for <br>
<strong>creating <u>web</u> pages</strong> <br>
and web applications.</p><p>Web browsers receive HTML documents <br>
from a web server or from local storage and render them <br>
into multimedia web pages. </p><p>HTML describes the structure of <br>   
a web page semantically and originally included cues <br>
for the appearance of the document.</p> <br>

HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With <br> 
HTML constructs, images and other objects, such as interactive <br>     
forms, may be embedded into the rendered page. It provides <br>
a means to create structured documents by denoting structural <br>
semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, <br>
links, quotes and other items. HTML elements are delineated <br>
by tags, written using angle brackets. <br>
